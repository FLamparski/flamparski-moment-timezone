# Moment with Timezones

This is an unofficial Meteor package for [Moment.js](https://momentjs.org/),
a JavaScript date and time manipulation library. If you're looking for
the official Meteor package, it's the [momentjs:moment](https://atmospherejs.com/momentjs/moment)
package. That, however, does not include moment-timezone.

## What's in the box?

Moment 2.9.0 and Moment Timezone 0.2.5 as per the Bower moment-timezone package
on the 11th of February 2015.

## Locale X is missing!

This package exports all the English language locales available. If you
require another locale, please edit package.js accordingly.
